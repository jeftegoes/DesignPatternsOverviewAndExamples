# 1. Overview

- Design pattern are common architectural approaches.
- Popularized by the [Gang of Four book (1994)](http://wiki.c2.com/?GangOfFour).
- Universally relevant.
  - Internalized in some programming languages.
  - Libraries

# Gamma categorization

- Design Patters are typically split in to three categories.
- This is called Gamma Categorization after Erick Gamma, one of GoF authors.
- Create patterns:
  - Deal with the creation (construction) of objects.
  - Explicit (constructor) vs. implicit (DI, reflection, etc.).
  - Wholesale (single statement) vs. piecewise (step-by-step).
- Structural patters:
  - Concerned with the structure (e.g., class members).
  - Many patterns are wrappers that mimic the underlying class interface.
  - Stress the importante of good API design.
- Behavioral patterns:
  - They are all different, no central theme.

# Builder

- When construction gets a little bit too complicated.
- When piecewise object construction is complicated, provide an API for doing it succinctly.

## Motivation

- Some objects are simple and can be created in a single constructor call.
- Other objects require a lot of ceremony to create.
- Having an object with 10 constructor arguments is not productive.
- Instead, opt for piecewise construction.
- Builder provides an API for constructing an object step-by-step.
